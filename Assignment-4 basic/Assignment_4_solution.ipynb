      "most positive:  Ive posted an UPDATE at the endFirst let me state that I have been buying products from Amazon for the past 12 years  I love Amazon  I love the reviews because they have always played a part sometimes more sometimes less in the products I decide to purchase  For some reason I have never left a review I know  Until now  I feel such an urge to express how much my husband and I love this strollerMy first son will turn 7 next month  We purchased an Evenflo strollercar seat travel system for him in 2005  We hated it  We used the car seat but never EVER used the stroller  It was big bulky heavy and a pain in the rear  I think my husband hated it even more than I did  I wore my first son everywhere instead of putting him in a stroller  Fast forward to 6 years later and we have our second son in September of 2011  I researched for months  I wanted to find a stroller that had several qualities  Looks  As shallow as it may seem I wanted a stroller that wasnt ugly  I wasnt interested in any fancy or cutesy designs on the fabric  I wanted simple and sleek  I wanted something that my husband would not mind pushing around either  Weight  I wanted something that was not super heavy  QualityDurability  I was looking for something that would hold up through months and months of theme park visits and ultimately through daily runs  Ease  Meaning that I wanted it to fold easily and be a stroller that I could easily put in and out of my car without looking like my back was going to give out and I would collapse   Price  I wanted something under 100  I find that the more expensive a stroller is the sleeker it looks a shame that more less expensive strollers arent more attractive  I wanted the look and the quality for under 100  Able to use with a Graco car seat  I knew I did not really want to purchase another combo travel system of any kind really  Canopy  Needed a bigger one to protect from the FL sunSo with these key things in mind I researched for hours upon hours for the last couple months of my pregnancy  I still held off  I wanted to make the right purchase and not settle for another crap stroller that would be a huge disappointment  When my son was a month old I pulled the trigger and purchased the Joovy Scooter Stroller in Greenie  BEST DECISION EVER  We live in Florida  Below the freeze line in FL  an hour south of Tampa on the water  Here is my take on the Pros and Cons of the Joovy  I hope it might help out someone else who is on the fencePROs1  Cost  9999  True it was just one penny shy of my limit I set  But it was under  I had a giftcard from a family member so the stroller really only cost me 4999  A steal2  Assembly  This was almost totally assembled when I received it  It has been about 8 months since I purchased this so my memory may fail me on the exact details of the assemblybut I seem to remember only installing the brake bar and the wheels others may recall more but the fact is that it was super easy overall and I did not need to wait for the assistance of my husband  I noticed right away that I was lacking the right size hub cap for one of the back wheels  This is only a cosmetic feature  It does not in any way mess with how the stroller would function but still I felt that I should call the Joovy customer service to inquire  I dont remember waiting at all on hold  The lady I spoke to was super friendly and practically no questions asked she Fed Exed me a couple of hub caps for free  I got them in a couple of days3  Ease  It does take both hands to fold the stroller up but it is super easy after getting the hang of it  It only took me a couple of tries before I became a pro  No struggling in parking lots looking like the stressed out parent that wants to pull an Office Space on the stroller with a bat  There was an Up All Night episode that dealt with beating a stroller to pieces in a parking lot  I think all of us as parents have been there at one point or another with some piece of baby equipment  It unfolds so easily its ridiculous  I love it  You just pull the handles up and thats that4  Maneuverability  Some people had mentioned that they wish the wheels werent plastic  It is true that they are indeed plastic  But I have never had a problem with them  My stroller feels like its gliding on ice for the most part  Only a couple of times have the wheels gotten stucktangledwhatever  I would not even consider this an issue but felt it was worth a mention at least Seriously in 8 months it may have happened twice  Thats it And this stroller has had a LOT of mileage5  The handles  There seems to be a discussion about the handles being rough  My husband nor I have EVER had an issue with this  The handles are great  We live 1 hour and 15 minutes away from Disney World and had annual passes  We went at least two weekends a month spending 12 hours a day at the parks  We just purchased annual passes to Universal recently and spend just as much time there  We have never received a blister from the handles and never felt that they were rough  They have a nice secure grip making it easy to maneuver through crowds and onehanded love the design of the handles  I am not exaggerating when I say we spend 12 hour days at the parks  The stroller makes it such a breeze  I also wear my baby some in the Ergo Performance in Spring Green also purchased off Amazon the green color is a pretty close match to this stroller for anyone wondering but he really loves this stroller  I also run at the park 5 or 6 times a week with this stroller  No it is not listed as a jogging stroller but it works perfectly for me  I run anywhere from 14 miles at a time each day and have never had an issue  I run mostly with only one hand on the handles and it turns beautifully as I run6  Durability  What can I say  I think Ive already said it all  This stroller has held up wonderfully throughout all of our theme park adventures and through each of my morning runs at the park  I have no complaints7  Looks  I have to say this stroller is beautiful  I adore it  It is sleek modern slim but durable  The Greenie color is GORGEOUS its my favorite color And I can find it easily at the theme parks8  Basket  There is PLENTY of storage underneath in the oversized basket  We can fit a big diaper bag blankets toys a purse and more9  Reclining  The seat reclines very easily  If you recline it as far back as it will go it makes changing diapers easy  When my son is awake and wants to look around I put him in the high back seating position  If he wants to sleep I just recline  Not much to it  Pretty simple and easy10 Car Seat  I had no problems at all attaching our Graco car seat to this stroller when my son was younger no car seat adapter needed  We dont need to do this anymore but it worked great when we did11 Weight  It is still a little heavy but honestly I have no problem lifting it in and out of my Element or my husbands Accord  It folds up nicely and lies pretty flat  Im 55 and 115 lbs  I have no problem lifting this  Its hard to explain without you seeing it in person but the stroller is pretty slim  It is not bulky like most12  Foot brakes  I have never had a problem with my feet hitting the brakes even on all my runs  Neither has my husband he is 6 tall  The brake works great as it should13  Foot Rest  This is a cool feature for the little one14  The CANOPY  The canopy on this is AMAZING  It is super large  I love it  Like Ive already mentioned we are in the FL heat all year long  This canopy is awesome at keeping my little guy protected from too much sun  I also like the clear window I can look through at him which I like to do when I am running to see if he fell asleep or not 15 Extra pockets  There are side pockets for your little one to store extra toys or as I do I put his bottles there and take them out as he needs them  There is also a large zippered pocket on the back of the stroller16  Cup Holder  I rarely use the cup holder as a cup holder  I usually use it to hold my phone as I run but it does have a cup holder17  The fabric  Love it  It has not faded even in the FL sun  It is comfortable for my son and easy for me to wipe up or to shake the sand off as we have lots of beach visits  While I wouldnt consider this the best stroller to push through sand we have done it  We live where the beaches are super soft sand so you have to pop a wheelie with the front wheels being totally air borne to push it through but we have done it several times  Also the rain seems to roll right off the fabric mostly  The fabric comes off for washing too18 Extras  My son LOVES propping his foot up on the bar as we stroll while Im walking or running with him  Also we love the super padded cushions on the buckles for his chest  And this buckles in such a way that would be harder for a toddler to figure out I would think but super easy for parentsCONsI dont have any  The only con is not buying this You cant beat the quality for the money hereThis is my favorite stroller I have ever used  My husband agrees  It is so easy to push along on flat or bumpy surfaces  I recommend this to all of my friends that are having babies  This was my very best purchase this time around  We have been so happy with it and our 9 month old son also seems to enjoy itUPDATE 91412  Im now successfully running over 6 miles at a time with my baby almost 1 year old boy in this stroller I run a minimum of 3 milesday 5 days a week but I have one longer run each week also I love it  The wheels have had a LOT of mileage on them and they have held up quite well so far at some point I might have to replace them as I am constantly upping my mileage  So far in the 14 days in September I have run over 42 miles and walked over 25 miles while pushing this Joovy  I dont understand the rough handles comments at all  Ive never ever had a blister or any complaints about the handles  They work out so well for me when I run because they give me great control mostly I run with only one hand on the handles  Also I get so many compliments on the looks of this stroller\n",

      "most negative:  I am a researchaholic in general and have researched many different baby products over the past 5 years due to being a mother of 3 and wanting to get the best for the price and not wanting to settle for less  I live in the Northeast US so it gets really cold and the weather changes frequently and in extremes on a daily if not hourly basis  Anyway here are the brands Ive usedowed andor researched extensively and the comparisonsJolly Jumper Arctic Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover JJAJolly Jumper Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover JJSummer Infant Poshpouch SPCozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover CCBabys Cozy World Microfiber  Fleece Carrier Cover BC yes the CC and the BC are differentJJ Cole infantoriginal bundle me JJCJJ Cole toddler bundle me  JJTOKJolly Jumper Artic JJA is awesome I would rate it the best one out of all  It is a shower cap cover for the infant car seat it has a blanket inside that you can velcro closed to keep the babys face covered and warm and you can velcro it up to stay open when the baby when you put the baby in the car out of weathers elements  It has two zippers which allow you to open the carrier and easily access the baby keep the baby from over heating and you can also flap the middle piece down to keep it completely off the baby  The blanket is a nice feature of this cover  You can use it alone with the flap open on a warmer day and you can also flap it down away from the baby as well when not in use  Another nice thing about the blanket is you can wrap it around baby to keep them warm there is enough material on both sides to do this  Some reviewers of this and other carriers stated that there were gaps around the handle this is true of mostly all the shower cap covers except you can adjust it to cover these gaps  Also you can take the wrap around blanket and cover the baby as well as feed it through the gaps on the sides to close them if the cover cannot be adjusted to fit around the bottom to close that area  The outer portion is nylon like a jacket and it is waterproof the fleece is substantial and it keeps the infant very warm This is an expensive carrier but well worth the money  This is top notchJolly Jumper is just like the carrier described above but without the attached blanket  Again overall an excellent carrier  It is not that much less than the JJA and no matter what climate I would pay the extra money for the JJA just because you can use the blanket alone with the flap of the outer portion of the JJ out and it is a very nice feature to have in the coverSummer Infant Poshpouch SP is another shower cap cover for the infant carseat but it has an opening in the top with no flap to velcro over babys face  I owned this before the JJA and here are some differences  It is a much thinner material the fleece isnt as substantial and the outer portion is not waterproof or nylon but a fleece polyester material  The opening is rather large and I felt as though breezeswind would go right through the hole and it is definitely not as effective in making the baby too warm esp in colder conditions  To remedy this problem I put a blanket on under the cover and the baby seemed better on 30 degree days from the house to the car but not to take a walk  I also had to put a hat and make sure the blanket was high on baby to cover the babys neck or use something to make sure babys neck was covered due to the hole being so big  It also gaps more on the side then the JJA and the JJ  The SP only has one zipper to unzip the baby when inside  And when you want to keep the baby inside the carrier you really have to take the whole thing off to leave the baby in to not be covered  And it is hard to get the baby out without pushing it asideAND MOST IMPORTANTLY  PLEASE SEE  it was very scary when I discovered that when you place it on correctly and put it over the infant carseat I would put my infant carseat into the holster and it WOULD NOT I repeat WOULD NOT lATCH INTO THE BASE  There was no way of knowing this unless you checked I check my baby each time to make sure the carseat is latched in just by habit but it would not even be partially latched just completely unlatched  I felt this was unacceptable  Even when I tried to adjust it by pulling the bottom portion where the babys feet would be up the cover bc of the elastic would just come up bunch and be partially off with a gap under the babys feet so I feel this carrier is a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY  I paid 23 the cost of the JJACozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover CC A lot of people think this is the BC and it is the same price but it is not  It is a cheap spin off of the BC even though it is the same price  The fabric is less substantial it is honestly more like the SP  Not worth the money and dont make the mistake of getting itBabys Cozy World Microfiber  Fleece Carrier Cover BC Is BABYS COZY WORLD uses a type of microfiber called microsuede which is a soft fabric made from synthetic fibers that are an imitation to suede  It seems like it is a good bang for your buck coming in around twenty dollars which is half of the JJA  The only thing is if you live in a really rainy climate I dont think it would be as waterproof being microsuede as the JJ or the JJA material  Another reviewer stated that the BABYS COZY WORLD is reversible which I am not sure how it can be reversible deeming that it does have a flap that goes over the infants face like the CC JJA and JJThe reviewer also stated that the BC has pacifier clips which would be a nice feature for toys as well and that is is very thick for all weather and it is the same price as the CC  ONE THING that many reviews said about the CC and the BC is that the zippers can be dangerous bc they line up in the same place as a newborns eyes and have the potential for scratching the cornea  With the JJ and the JJA the zippers do not seem as though they would reach this far  Maybe the CC and the BC have larger zippers that might spin around in opposite directions esp if it is reversible  It does have the zippers on both sides to unzip and expose the infant nicely when inside and do not want the infant to overheat while in the carrier  For the price this seems like it would be a good carrier as well and I would rate the the BC a close second and very comparable to the JJ but does not have a blanket feature like the JJAJJ Cole infantoriginal bundle me JJCis what I owned with my first child who was a premature infant and I only got about 7 months of use out of this cover  That is why I got the toddler JJ cole after  It is a different type of carrier than all the others that are reviewed above being that it is not a shower cap style it has an underside to the carrier that is placed under the harness straps and then a layer goes over the baby and is zippered down and around the bottom  FIRST OF ALL THIS IS DANGEROUS which I never knew as a new mom and why they even CAN SELL them as carseat covers is beyond me because if you get into an accident it compresses under the infant because of the added bulk between the seat and the child it is like the infant is wearing a jacket so there is more room in between the harness and the infant deeming it unsafe  Also JJ cole now has the lite JJ cole and says that it passed crash tests but The Bundle me Lites openings do not come anywhere near the hip straps of the harness meaning they would be improperly routed thus creating slack  Here is a picture  No certified carseat technicians recommend this aftermarket product for the carseat  Any many if not all carseat companies state if an aftermarket product is used inside the carseat between the harness and baby it will void all guarantees for safety  NOT GOODJJ Cole toddler JJT  Had this mostly with my first child and second and would not use now dt the same reason above with the JJ  But it could be nice with a stroller  The only thing is you do need a hat and something to cover the babys neck as wellIn summary1The Jolly Jumper Artic JJA wins the race I am very very please with this product esp the blanket aspect that I think is well worth itThe JJ is basically the same product as the JJA but without the blanket2The Babys Cozy World Microfiber  Fleece Carrier Cover BC but make sure it is the BC and not the CC when you purchase it comes in a close second esp for the priceHope this review is helpful to you and you now wont have to go through the countless hours of research and will be getting a great product while not wasting any of your time or money on another worthless baby item\n"
